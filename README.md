## Development

### Install

```shell
yarn install
```

### Run

```shell
# Start keysd
keysd

# Start app
yarn server
yarn start
```

If you change anything in src/main, you'll need to restart (`yarn start`).
Anything changed in the renderer will be picked up automatically by `yarn server`, you rarely need to restart that.

You can run multiple instances by specifying a different app name and port:

```shell
# Start keysd (Keys2)
keysd -app Keys2 -port 22406

# Start app (Keys2)
yarn server
KP_APP=Keys2 KP_PORT=22406 yarn start
```
